       <h1>Happy Valentines</h1>

    <div class="paragraph" id="mainContent">
        <p>This is the first Valentines we spent with each other
            <br>So I decided to make a little website for yo that you can open whenever you want
            <br>this will be my first time making a proper website so please bear with me :3
            <br>I remember yesterday when you were taking a nap next to me
            <br>I don't know it just felt... peaceful. like my life is content.
            <br>And there I realized I would love to spend more time with you
            <br>more time together
            <br>share my life with you
            <br>Reina I want you to be a part of my life. right now you are already
            <br>an incredible part of my life that I truly treasure
            <br>Someone I would dedicate my life to
            <br>I miss you so much. Im writing this after the first class of 2nd semester
            <br>in class I was just thinking about skipping it just so I could be with you
            <br>during PE just seeing you happy playing badminton was such a joy for me
            <br>I wanted to hug you, kiss you, hold your arm, just be with you
            <br>but it is as if life is just against us.  time is against us
            <br>I would fight time itself to be with you
            <br>I hope you would like this website. I like to think that this is my
            <br>Promise to you that we will both have a bright future together
            <br>A future where I don't have to message you goodmorning anymore
            <br>or ask if you have eaten yesterday
            <br>I wish for the day where I can cook you breakfast and wake you up
            <br><strong>Reina I love you</strong>
