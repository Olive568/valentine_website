       <h1>Happy Valentines</h1> 
       <h2>From your boyfriend</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" id="mainContent">
        <p>This is the first Valentines we spent with each other
            <br>So I decided to make a little website for yo that you can open whenever you want
            <br>this will be my first time making a proper website so please bear with me :3
            <br>I remember yesterday when you were taking a nap next to me
            <br>I don't know it just felt... peaceful. like my life is content.
            <br>And there I realized I would love to spend more time with you
            <br>more time together
            <br>share my life with you
            <br>Reina I want you to be a part of my life. right now you are already
            <br>an incredible part of my life that I truly treasure
            <br>Someone I would dedicate my life to
            <br>I miss you so much. Im writing this after the first class of 2nd semester
            <br>in class I was just thinking about skipping it just so I could be with you
            <br>during PE just seeing you happy playing badminton was such a joy for me
            <br>I wanted to hug you, kiss you, hold your arm, just be with you
            <br>but it is as if life is just against us.  time is against us
            <br>I would fight time itself to be with you
            <br>I hope you would like this website. I like to think that this is my
            <br>Promise to you that we will both have a bright future together
            <br>A future where I don't have to message you goodmorning anymore
            <br>or ask if you have eaten yesterday
            <br>I wish for the day where I can cook you breakfast and wake you up
            <br><strong>Reina I love you</strong>

            <p>
                I was just minding my own business and..... relapsing during the assembly
                <br>Menzel was planning for a jamming session with me and sho
                <br>Sooooo I brought my electric guitar
                <br>my relapsing increased when Leanne was singing in front.
                <br>when the assembly ended I went out with menzel until...
                <br>Sir verge stopped me
                <br>this is something I did not expect but I am so glad
                <br>that it happened. you changed my life that day.
                <br>a day that I would forever cherish and love
                <br>I don't regret that I did not pay it mind at First.
                <br>It may seem odd but my idea is that it's the world's
                <br>way of making things better
                <br>better in a way that I should become more mature,
                <br>more loving,
                <br>more understanding,
                <br>before I could take your hand
                <br>Reina. You are one the best event that happened that day.
                <br>no
                <br>this year

                    The first time I held your hand I felt comfort.
                    <br>the feeling of our fingers rubbing together
                    <br>The warmth
                    <br>is something I look forward to everyday
                    <br>I think fondly to that day as it paved the way.
                    <br>into me falling in love with you
                    <br>It makes me happy that we spent time that day eventhough
                    <br>It was only less than an hour
                    <br>it's safe to say that day is a big step towards
                    <br>building our relationship
                    <br>AND ALSO IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I DROVE MY CAR TO school
                    <br>I started driving on my own because of you
                    <br>I really thank you for that
                    <br>and also when I cuddled with you for the first time
                    <br>It felt like all my worries went away

                    <br>now It has become a special place for me
                    <br>The place where I started falling in love
                    <br>It just felt so natural talking to you
                    <br>Sharing stories with you
                    <br>the way you look when you start talking
                    <br>The way a smile just creeps up to you
                    <br>I just wanted to hug you so bad
                    <br>I'm so happy that we were so compatible that day
                    <br>Actually Janaia asked me why I liked you Reina
                    <br>I told her about my experience there and how it made me comfy
                    <br>Happy
                    <br>And how it all felt so natural

                    I just wanted to surprise you when I went to town
                    <br>So I went to the anime shop in southmall
                    <br>and I remembered that you liked Cinnamorol.
                    <br>So I started looking for a Cinnamoroll
                    <br>But there was no plushie :/. that sucks
                    <br>So I saw a button so I got that instead
                    <br>oh yeah me And jamikos group were doing
                    <br>A project that time in southmall
                    <br>Good thing we finished early
                    <br>you looked so cute at town that time
                    <br>and when I gave it to you I lovedddd your reaction
                    <br>Actually I don't remember the reaction now
                    <br>All I know is that I found it really cuteee.
                    <br>And then your family showed up
                    <br>And you were like you don't know me which was funny while I was just at the corner
                    <br>But I knew not introducing myself would be really bad
                    <br>So I did. and I'll  be honest I wasn't really nervous
                    <br>As I was sure I want to start off serious with You
                    <br>I had a really fun time eating with your family 
                    <br>And I made sure to give a lasting impression on them
                    <br>I want them to know that I would be responsible and mature enough for you

                    This will be the first time I'll be driving to Alabang
                    <br>To festival
                    <br>I was anxious but really excited. This will be a big event of my life
                    <br>and boy when I picked you up you looked so amazing!!!!
                    <br>I realized that time that we both will have a really amazing time together
                    <br>I started driving and a bit quickly actually. but Don't worry you were in safe hands
                    <br>It was my first time driving there so I did not really know where to park
                    <br>I'm glad you helped me with the directions that time
                    <br>When we entered we saw Elliot. he was mocking my fit lmao
                    <br>so when we went to the theatre I did not really like the available movies
                    <br>But I was good with marvel so yeah we decided to watch it
                    <br>I really enjoyed the movie with you. I loved seeing your reactions
                    <br>And so we ate at pancake house
                    <br>I'm sorry for thinking about ramen kuroda
                    <br>It was really the only thing I thought of at the time
                    <br>Pancake house was pretty nostalgic though
                    <br>and lastly tim horton was really good. I love it
                    <br>I really love our first date. It was chill but also exciting
                    <br>I'm glad that I gave you a good experience
                    <br>still sucks I forgot the flowers =(

                    <br>My very first girlfriend
                    <br>It just hits very different that label
                    <br>Someone that trusts you. cares for you. is there for you, loves you
                    <br>It is something so beautiful that it makes me so happy
                    <br>I am sooooo happy that I am your boyfriend now. also your first
                    <br>The gojo figure I bought was from the cosplay convention. I knew I had to buy it
                    <br>though the love letter... I knew you would love it
                    <br>I'll be honest I was actually crying when I was writing it. my emotions were just flowing
                    <br>I love you so much Reina it's just so nice this feeling
                    <br>Of being in love with you. and being loved back
                    <br>And our first kiss....
                    <br>wow
                    <br>I loved how you were also kind of aggresive
                    <br>AND YOU GOT SO GOOD AT KISSING INSTANTLY
                    <br>You were so impressive at it I was surprised
                    <br>Dear joe will be such a good place for me
                    <br>As I will always remember that confession I made

                <p>
                    I 100% did not expect for anthonette to suggest going to my house
                    <br>I only went to the event in southville for you
                    <br>since I did start missing you again at that time
                    <br>I'm glad I did
                    <br>The event was fun. especially since you were theatre
                    <br>but when we went home anthonette decided we should go to my place
                    <br>So we did and damn that was an amazing decision
                    <br>I could have introduced you better to my parents
                    <br>but what matters is that they accept you as part of the family
                    <br>Actually when I was gonna introduce you my mom was shy and told me
                    <br>not to worry as you are already family now
                    <br>It was nice. we watched a movie together
                    <br>what was insane though was the kisses
                    <br>You were really aggresive and I love it
                    <br>but what I liked more is your sweetness. you are really sweet
                    <br>AND CUTE DURING THAT time
                    <br>YOU WERE SOOOOOOO CUTE
                    <br>I felt sad you had to go home but well
                    <br>theres always next time right?

                <p>
                    The original plan was for us to go to southmall and have a chill date
                    <br>well that kinda changed when tricia invited me to go to monthsary
                    <br>And I know you loved adventure so of so we went
                    <br>We also had a lot of fun waiting for my friends to come over
                    <br>I know you had a lot of fun too waiting
                    <br>so we were off to MOA 
                    <br>and when we arrived we first went to my friends
                    <br>And I left you...... stupid me. honestly I just did not want to leave my friend early
                    <br>I'm sorry for leaving you that time. also Thank you so much for lining up in KFC
                    <br>And so we ate KFC. it was nice as I was starving at the TIME
                    <br>And finally some alone time with you
                    <br>and so we went around in my hot af CIA cosplay
                    <br>We went outside and got onto the rides
                    <br>it was really fun especially the reactions of nhico and Michael
                    <br>and also you met hori. too bad we did not get to do the double date
                    <br>Ikea was actually pretty good. I would love to eat there again
                    <br>Overall I loved the experience eventhough it hurt my wallet a lot
                    <br>I loved the way you comforted me when I told you I was scared
                    <br>scared of your fam being angry for making you come home late
                    <br>I'm super thankful that you calmed me down
                    <br>I want to go to MOA with you again. just the two of us

                    The first time I spent a new year while having a girlfriend
                    <br>It's a nice experience. Though I wish I was able to spend it with you
                    <br>hell my family thinks its common courtesy for a guy to spend new year and christmas with the girl
                    <br>But we both know it's not possible knowing that we need to hide it for now
                    <br>God I wish for the day I could just introduce myself to your entire family
                    <br>As your boyfriend
                    <br>I wrote you a short letter on messenger that time
                    <br>I just felt it was right. I wanted to to something nice to you on new years
                    <br>And I did
                    <br>I was craving for you that time. your voice is just something I love hearing everyday
                    <br>and so we called and the rest was history
                    <br>I am so happy I started the year with you by my side
                    <br>We will make this year ours
                    <br>Happy new year my love

                    <br>and also unli wings. God I love unli wings
                    <br>But as you know things got a bit... heated
                    <br>I actually did not really expect it to be like that but oh well
                    <br>I guess new year means a new step in the relationship
                    <br>And I am so glad we can make that step together
                    <br>We also need to go to unli wings again. I love eating it so much its so worth It
                    <br>OH and also samgyup we should go there sometime
                    <br>Lmaooo we both are deafened on discord right now. and yes I am cramming this website
                    <br>Though with the money issue we might be stuck with chill dates for a while which is also good
                    <br>As long as I spend time with you I enjoy it a lot
                    <br>and this is the first time in many we will have similar Dates
                    <br>I enjoy it a lot though. just being with you.

                    I always kept thinking about you as I went to school
                    <br>realizing that I won't see you for two days. that sucked a lot
                    <br>especially since you just got a Hime cut. God you were so pretty
                    <br>actually in the retreat I kept replaying the two videos you sent to me
                    <br>and just stared at you
                    <br>your beauty
                    <br>complexion
                    <br>hair
                    <br>lips...
                    <br>I was really concerned when you told me you did not want to called
                    <br>I was kind of overthinking if I did something wrong
                    <br>though when you messaged me again the next day it made me happy
                    <br>I decided to make you a bouqet as I thought it would make you really happy
                    <br>1 of the flowers (the white ones) had so many ants inside its actually kinda creepy
                    <br>me and sho cleaned it up
                    <br>I still hate the prettiest flower fell apart before it got to you
                    <br>I felt sorry about the news. I did not really know what to say honestly
                    <br>I wanted to hug you, and just be there for you
                    <br>but school just sucks
                    <br>you indeed look just like the stars I saw that night
                    <br>or atleast I feel the same way when I look at you
                    <br>I wish I could have gazed upon them with you that night

                    <br>yours... is just perfect. the design the words it just feels me with joy
                    <br>sometimes when I can't sleep at night I would just read the letter you gave me
