       <h1>Happy Valentines</h1> 
       <h2>From your boyfriend</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" id="mainContent">
        <p>This is the first Valentines we spent with each other
            <br>So I decided to make a little website for yo that you can open whenever you want
            <br>this will be my first time making a proper website so please bear with me :3
            <br>I remember yesterday when you were taking a nap next to me
            <br>I don't know it just felt... peaceful. like my life is content.
            <br>And there I realized I would love to spend more time with you
            <br>more time together
            <br>share my life with you
            <br>Reina I want you to be a part of my life. right now you are already
            <br>an incredible part of my life that I truly treasure
            <br>Someone I would dedicate my life to
            <br>I miss you so much. Im writing this after the first class of 2nd semester
            <br>in class I was just thinking about skipping it just so I could be with you
            <br>during PE just seeing you happy playing badminton was such a joy for me
            <br>I wanted to hug you, kiss you, hold your arm, just be with you
            <br>but it is as if life is just against us.  time is against us
            <br>I would fight time itself to be with you
            <br>I hope you would like this website. I like to think that this is my
            <br>Promise to you that we will both have a bright future together
            <br>A future where I don't have to message you goodmorning anymore
            <br>or ask if you have eaten yesterday
            <br>I wish for the day where I can cook you breakfast and wake you up
            <br><strong>Reina I love you</strong>

            <p>
                I was just minding my own business and..... relapsing during the assembly
                <br>Menzel was planning for a jamming session with me and sho
                <br>Sooooo I brought my electric guitar
                <br>my relapsing increased when Leanne was singing in front.
                <br>when the assembly ended I went out with menzel until...
                <br>Sir verge stopped me
                <br>this is something I did not expect but I am so glad
                <br>that it happened. you changed my life that day.
                <br>a day that I would forever cherish and love
                <br>I don't regret that I did not pay it mind at First.
                <br>It may seem odd but my idea is that it's the world's
                <br>way of making things better
                <br>better in a way that I should become more mature,
                <br>more loving,
                <br>more understanding,
                <br>before I could take your hand
                <br>Reina. You are one the best event that happened that day.
                <br>no
                <br>this year

                    The first time I held your hand I felt comfort.
                    <br>the feeling of our fingers rubbing together
                    <br>The warmth
                    <br>is something I look forward to everyday
                    <br>I think fondly to that day as it paved the way.
                    <br>into me falling in love with you
                    <br>It makes me happy that we spent time that day eventhough
                    <br>It was only less than an hour
                    <br>it's safe to say that day is a big step towards
                    <br>building our relationship

                    <br>It just felt so natural talking to you
                    <br>Sharing stories with you
                    <br>the way you look when you start talking
