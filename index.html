       <h1>Happy Valentines</h1> 
       <h2>From your boyfriend</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" id="mainContent">
        <p>This is the first Valentines we spent with each other
            <br>So I decided to make a little website for yo that you can open whenever you want
            <br>this will be my first time making a proper website so please bear with me :3
            <br>I remember yesterday when you were taking a nap next to me
            <br>I don't know it just felt... peaceful. like my life is content.
            <br>And there I realized I would love to spend more time with you
            <br>more time together
            <br>share my life with you
            <br>Reina I want you to be a part of my life. right now you are already
            <br>an incredible part of my life that I truly treasure
            <br>Someone I would dedicate my life to
            <br>I miss you so much. Im writing this after the first class of 2nd semester
            <br>in class I was just thinking about skipping it just so I could be with you
            <br>during PE just seeing you happy playing badminton was such a joy for me
            <br>I wanted to hug you, kiss you, hold your arm, just be with you
            <br>but it is as if life is just against us.  time is against us
            <br>I would fight time itself to be with you
            <br>I hope you would like this website. I like to think that this is my
            <br>Promise to you that we will both have a bright future together
            <br>A future where I don't have to message you goodmorning anymore
            <br>or ask if you have eaten yesterday
            <br>I wish for the day where I can cook you breakfast and wake you up
            <br><strong>Reina I love you</strong>

            <p>
                I was just minding my own business and..... relapsing during the assembly
                <br>Menzel was planning for a jamming session with me and sho
                <br>Sooooo I brought my electric guitar
                <br>my relapsing increased when Leanne was singing in front.
                <br>when the assembly ended I went out with menzel until...
                <br>Sir verge stopped me
                <br>this is something I did not expect but I am so glad
                <br>that it happened. you changed my life that day.
                <br>a day that I would forever cherish and love
                <br>I don't regret that I did not pay it mind at First.
                <br>It may seem odd but my idea is that it's the world's
                <br>way of making things better
                <br>better in a way that I should become more mature,
                <br>more loving,
                <br>more understanding,
                <br>before I could take your hand
                <br>Reina. You are one the best event that happened that day.
                <br>no
                <br>this year
                <br>I love you so much

                <p>
                    The first time I held your hand I felt comfort.
                    <br>the feeling of our fingers rubbing together
                    <br>The warmth
                    <br>is something I look forward to everyday
                    <br>I think fondly to that day as it paved the way.
                    <br>into me falling in love with you
                    <br>It makes me happy that we spent time that day eventhough
                    <br>It was only less than an hour
                    <br>it's safe to say that day is a big step towards
                    <br>building our relationship
                    <br>AND ALSO IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I DROVE MY CAR TO school
                    <br>I started driving on my own because of you
                    <br>I really thank you for that
                    <br>and also when I cuddled with you for the first time
                    <br>It felt like all my worries went away
                    <br>You truly are wonderful

                    I only really started drinking dunkin donuts coffeee because of you
                    <br>Really because it's near our school so we can go there often
                    <br>now It has become a special place for me
                    <br>The place where I started falling in love
                    <br>It just felt so natural talking to you
                    <br>Sharing stories with you
                    <br>the way you look when you start talking
                    <br>The way a smile just creeps up to you
                    <br>I just wanted to hug you so bad
                    <br>I'm so happy that we were so compatible that day
                    <br>Actually Janaia asked me why I liked you Reina
                    <br>I told her about my experience there and how it made me comfy
                    <br>Happy
                    <br>And how it all felt so natural

                    I just wanted to surprise you when I went to town
                    <br>So I went to the anime shop in southmall
                    <br>and I remembered that you liked Cinnamorol.
                    <br>So I started looking for a Cinnamoroll
                    <br>But there was no plushie :/. that sucks
                    <br>So I saw a button so I got that instead
                    <br>oh yeah me And jamikos group were doing
                    <br>A project that time in southmall
                    <br>Good thing we finished early
                    <br>you looked so cute at town that time
                    <br>and when I gave it to you I lovedddd your reaction
                    <br>Actually I don't remember the reaction now
                    <br>All I know is that I found it really cuteee.
                    <br>And then your family showed up
                    <br>And you were like you don't know me which was funny while I was just at the corner
                    <br>But I knew not introducing myself would be really bad
                    <br>So I did. and I'll  be honest I wasn't really nervous
                    <br>As I was sure I want to start off serious with You
                    <br>I had a really fun time eating with your family 
                    <br>And I made sure to give a lasting impression on them
                    <br>I want them to know that I would be responsible and mature enough for you

                    This will be the first time I'll be driving to Alabang
                    <br>To festival
                    <br>I was anxious but really excited. This will be a big event of my life
                    <br>and boy when I picked you up you looked so amazing!!!!
                    <br>I realized that time that we both will have a really amazing time together
                    <br>I started driving and a bit quickly actually. but Don't worry you were in safe hands
                    <br>It was my first time driving there so I did not really know where to park
                    <br>I'm glad you helped me with the directions that time
                    <br>When we entered we saw Elliot. he was mocking my fit lmao
                    <br>so when we went to the theatre I did not really like the available movies
                    <br>But I was good with marvel so yeah we decided to watch it
                    <br>I really enjoyed the movie with you. I loved seeing your reactions
                    <br>And so we ate at pancake house
                    <br>I'm sorry for thinking about ramen kuroda
                    <br>It was really the only thing I thought of at the time
                    <br>Pancake house was pretty nostalgic though
                    <br>and lastly tim horton was really good. I love it
                    <br>I really love our first date. It was chill but also exciting
                    <br>I'm glad that I gave you a good experience
